# CSPGuardian

Your codebase's security superhero, fighting XSS villains one inline script at a time!

Tired of pentesters giving you the side-eye because your CSP policy is basically `script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' *`?  
Worried about that legacy .NET app that's held together with inline scripts and duct tape?  
Want to actually pass a security audit without rewriting your entire codebase?

CSPGuardian is here to save the day!

A powerful CLI tool that helps .NET/C# developers transform their codebases from CSP-violation nightmares into security-compliant masterpieces. Automatically detect, fix, and generate proper Content Security Policies - because `unsafe-inline` is not a security feature, it's a cry for help.

## What CSPGuardian Does

Think of CSPGuardian as your personal security consultant that:
- Scans your entire codebase (HTML, Razor, Web Forms, JS, CSS - you name it!)
- Cleans up inline scripts and styles (externalize, hash, or nonce them)
- Generates proper CSP policies that actually work
- Handles legacy .NET without requiring a full rewrite
- Reports everything in beautiful JSON/CSV/Markdown formats

All while keeping your sanity intact!

## Features That'll Make You Smile

### Codebase Scanning
Recursively hunts down those pesky inline scripts and styles like a bloodhound. Finds:
- Inline `<script>` tags (the usual suspects)
- Inline `<style>` tags (sneaky CSS violators)
- Event handlers (`onclick`, `onload`, etc. - the old-school way)
- Dynamic code execution (`eval()`, `Function()` - the dangerous stuff)
- Legacy .NET patterns (WebResource.axd, ViewState shenanigans)

### Cleanup Options (Pick Your Poison)

**Externalize**  
"Get that script out of my HTML!"  
Extracts inline content to proper `.js`/`.css` files. Your HTML will thank you.

**Hashing**  
"Fingerprint everything!"  
Computes SHA-256/384/512 hashes for CSP whitelisting. Because trust, but verify.

**Noncing**  
"One-time use only!"  
Generates per-request nonces with ready-to-use code snippets. Fresh and secure every time.

### CSP Policy Generation
Builds proper CSP headers that won't make security auditors cry. Includes:
- `script-src` and `style-src` directives (with hashes/nonces)
- `strict-dynamic` support (for the modern apps)
- Report-only mode (for the cautious)
- Legacy .NET compatibility notes (for the brave)

### Framework Support
Works with:
- Modern .NET Core/Blazor (the cool kids)
- Legacy .NET (MVC 4/Web Forms - we don't judge)
- Static sites (simple but effective)
- JS frameworks (React, Angular, Vue - the modern stack)

### Reporting & Auditing
Generate beautiful reports in:
- Markdown (for humans)
- JSON (for machines)
- CSV (for spreadsheets)

Perfect for pentest handoffs, compliance audits, or just showing your boss you care about security!

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK or later (because we're modern like that)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/kamakauzy/CSPGuardian.git
cd CSPGuardian

# Build it
dotnet build

# Publish it (optional, but recommended)
dotnet publish -c Release
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Scan (The "What Have I Done?" Command)
```bash
cspguard scan --path ./MyApp --framework modern-dotnet
```
See what violations you have. Knowledge is power!

### Scan with Hash Cleanup (The "Fix It Now" Command)
```bash
cspguard scan --path ./MyApp --framework modern-dotnet --cleanup hash --output policy.csp
```
Automatically hash everything and generate a CSP policy. Magic!

### Legacy .NET Mode (The "Help Me, I'm Stuck" Command)
```bash
cspguard scan --path ./LegacyApp --framework legacy-dotnet --legacy-mode --cleanup externalize
```
For those old MVC 4/Web Forms apps that refuse to die. We've got your back!

### CI/CD Mode (The "Break the Build" Command)
```bash
cspguard scan --path ./MyApp --ci-mode --report-format json
```
Fail your CI pipeline if violations are found. Because security matters!

### Dry Run (The "Just Looking" Command)
```bash
cspguard scan --path ./MyApp --cleanup externalize --dry-run
```
See what would happen without actually doing it. Safety first!

## Command Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--path` | `-p` | Path to scan (required) |
| `--framework` | `-f` | Framework: `modern-dotnet`, `legacy-dotnet`, `static`, `js-modern`, `js-legacy` |
| `--cleanup` | `-c` | Strategy: `externalize`, `hash`, `nonce`, or `none` |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output file for CSP policy (default: `policy.csp`) |
| `--dry-run` | | Preview changes without applying them |
| `--legacy-mode` | | Enable legacy .NET mode (MVC 4/Web Forms) |
| `--ci-mode` | | Exit with error code if violations found |
| `--report-format` | `-r` | Report format: `json`, `csv`, `md` |

## What You'll Get

After running CSPGuardian, you'll find:
- `policy.csp` - Your shiny new CSP policy (ready to deploy!)
- `report.md` (or `.json`/`.csv`) - A detailed report of all violations and fixes

## Supported File Types

CSPGuardian can scan:
- HTML/HTM files
- CSHTML (Razor views)
- ASPX (Web Forms - yes, those still exist)
- ASCX (User Controls)
- JavaScript files (.js)
- CSS files (.css)

## Violation Types

CSPGuardian detects and reports:

| Type | Description | Severity |
|------|-------------|----------|
| InlineScript | Inline `<script>` tags without `src` | High |
| InlineStyle | Inline `<style>` tags | Medium |
| EventHandler | Event handler attributes (`onclick`, etc.) | High |
| DynamicInline | Dynamic code (`eval()`, `Function()`) | High |
| LegacyWebResource | WebResource.axd references | Low |
| ViewStateEmbedded | ViewState with embedded script | Medium |

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Modern .NET App
```bash
cspguard scan --path ./src --framework modern-dotnet --cleanup hash --output csp-policy.txt
```
Perfect for your shiny new .NET 8 app!

### Example 2: That Old MVC 4 App Nobody Wants to Touch
```bash
cspguard scan --path ./LegacyMVC4 --framework legacy-dotnet --legacy-mode --cleanup externalize
```
Because sometimes you have to work with what you've got.

### Example 3: CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```bash
cspguard scan --path ./app --ci-mode --report-format json
```
Automate security checks in your pipeline. Set it and forget it!
